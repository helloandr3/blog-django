# blog-django-api

This Blogs API allows clients to consume a blog service. For now only post and comment operation endpoints are implemented; however news features could be added in the future.

This service was built with: Django Framework, Django-Rest-Framework, SimpleJWT and drf_spectacular to generate the swagger documentation.

You can test it yourself [here]() by creating a user. Password validation is disabled for testing convenience.
